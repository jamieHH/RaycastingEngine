# 3D Raycasting Engine
## The Idea
I am experimenting with ideas for a modern take on classic dungeon crawlers based on popular games of a gone by era where things where simpler. 

I'm finding out if I can I an recapture the old charm of games such as Daggerfall and Ultima Underworld but in a modernised ergonomic application.

## Features
* 2.5D **Worlds** comprised of **Blocks**, **Entities** and Sprites
* Level changes and portals
* Triggerable **Doors**,  **Switches** and traps
* Multiple **Player** and non-player **Entities** with custom AI attributes and behaviours
* **Inventory** and **Item** systems for characters including equipable **Weapons**, consumable **Potions** and castable **Spells**
* Character **health** and **combat** systems
